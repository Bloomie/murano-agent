Murano
======
Murano Project introduces an application catalog, which allows application
developers and cloud administrators to publish various cloud-ready
applications in a browsableâ€Ž categorised catalog, which may be used by the
cloud users (including the inexperienced ones) to pick-up the needed
applications and services and composes the reliable environments out of them
in a "push-the-button" manner.

murano-agent
============
Murano Agent is a VM-side guest agent that accepts commands from
Murano Conductor and executes them. We have two Agent implementations
targeting different platforms, but eventually we going to end up with
Python Agent that works on Linux and uses new execution plan format
described in `Unified Agent <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Murano/UnifiedAgent>`_
